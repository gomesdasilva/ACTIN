### Activity Indices Calculator

Reads fits files from HARPS and HARPS-N spectrographs, and rdb tables, and outputs user defined spectral activity indices.


### Requires the following Python modules:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- astropy
- appdirs (included)


### Installation:

Use `pip install actin` or copy the github repository (in releases) to a directory of your choice and install via `python setup.py install`.

The `config_lines.txt` file is the line configuration file (instructions inside). This file is used to add line parameters to calculate any index as long as the line cores and bandpasses are inside the spectral range and spectral orders range (e2ds files) of the spectrograph. ACTIN will check this at start and give an error message if line parameters don't match the spectra.

This file is available from the directory each OS uses for storing user data:

For OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/<AppName>`

For Windows: `C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\Local Settings\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>` or possibly `C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>`

For Linux: `~/.local/share/<AppName>`

To get your path to the configuration file use `actin -cfg True`


### Quick start:

Usage:

`actin [-f files] [-i indices] [-s output path] [-p output path] [-obj object_name] [-tl target list] [-del True/False] [-w line flux weight] [-n normalisation of flux] [-cfg True/False]`


Arguments:

`-h` : Gives a description of the arguments available.

`-f` str/list : Fits file(s) (formats e2ds, s1d, s1d_*_rv, or ADP) or rdb table(s) with required headers `obj`, `date`, `bjd`, `wave`, `flux`, `error_pixel` (optional) to be read.

`-i` list : List of indices to calculate. Indices ids must match the ones in the config file `config_lines.txt`. If `False` no indices are calculated (default).

`-s` str : Save output to .rdb table in specified path. If `False` no output table is saved (default).

`-p` str : Save plots of the lines used to calculate the indices in the specified path. If `same` uses the table output path as specified in `-s`. If `False` no plots are saved (default).

`-tl` list : List of stars to select from `files`. Default is `None`.

`-del` bool : If `True` deletes output file for the same star(s) and file type. Default is `False`.

`-obj` str : Object name to override the one from fits files in case the star has multiple names (ex. Proxima, ProximaCen, Gl551). Default is `None`.

`-w` str : Function to weight the integrated flux. If `blaze` the flux is multiplied by the blaze function, if `None` the flux is not weighted (default).

`-n` str : Normalisation of the flux: if `band` the sum is normalised by the bandpass wavelength value in angstroms, if `npixels` by the number of pixels in the bandpass (default), if `weight` by the sum of the weight function inside the bandpass, if `None` the integrated flux is not normalised.

`-cfg` bool : If `True` gives the path to the configuration file. Default is `False`.

`-t` str : Tests the program using the test fits files provided. Use `e2ds`, `s1d` or `adp` to test e2ds, s1d or ADP files, respectively. The code searches for the required files automatically.

### Testing the code with minimum arguments:

The example below will test the code using the test files provided in the package.

`actin -t e2ds`

NOTE: If not installed via pip, use `python actin.py` instead of `actin`.

### Example for multiple files:

`actin -f ../fits/*/*e2ds_A.fits -i I_CaII I_Ha -s ../output -p same -del True -tl Gl273 Gl581`

This will execute ACTIN for all the subdirectories inside `../fits/` with files ending with `e2ds_A.fits`, calculate the indices `I_CaII` and `I_Ha`, output the data to `../output/star_names`, save spectra of the line regions to the same directory as data, and, before running the code, delete any output file that was previously there, in this case `Gl273_e2ds_actin.rdb` and `Gl581_e2ds_actin.rdb` files. Only fits files belonging to the stars chosen in `-tl` will be read, in this case `Gl273` and `Gl581`. In this case, the flux is not weighted (-w None, default) and is normalised by the number of pixels in the passband (-n npixels, default).
